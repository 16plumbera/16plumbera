### Share the truth

<img src="priestbot.webp" width="40%" style="max-width: 200px;">

A generative engine shaped by magisterial authority, supporting the needs of the modern church.

---

People have questions. Where do they go first to get them answered? 

A search engine. 

From there, they find websites, forums, blogs, books, YouTube channels, podcasts, etc. Especially for very specific questions, finding the answer can be effortful.

---

Those outside the Church openly speak against her witness, and within the Church are plenty who (knowingly or unknowingly) lead others astray.

The internet gives a voice to all opinions, and mainstream AI platforms are trained on everything.

---

The Church needs a central information engine that captures the benefits of AI. 

Obviously, the engine itself cannot have magisterial authority, because its outputs are (to some extent) random. 

But the Church can curate its source libraries and oversee its design. 

---

If designed carefully, this is a tremendous opportunity to share the Church's teachings with the faithful——and to dynamically package our tradition for the secular world as well.

On the next page, I list my reasons for belief in this vision.

| Problem | Opportunity |
|----------|-----------|
| Fragmented resources | With zero clicks, learn about everything from apologetics to canon law |
| Individualized instruction is limited | Individualized faith formation is no longer limited by the availability of priests |
| Limited analytics | By collecting and categorizing questions, AI can parse out spiritual needs of the laity by region, age, etc——informs evangelization strategies |
|||

---

| Problem | Opportunity |
|----------|-----------|
| Physical disabilities | Text-speech interfacing and limitless integration potential (Siri, Amazon Echo, etc.) |
| Economic disparities | Convenience serves the poor and overworked |
| Language barriers | Can curate separate libraries for each language (translation risks errors) |
| Adaptable and scalable | Can constantly be monitored, refined, and expanded for different use cases |
|||

---

| Problem | Opportunity |
|----------|-----------|
| Inconsistent teaching | One curated, dominant resource with source references |
| Searching for answers is inefficient and effortful | Synthesize the most relevant excerpts from an expansive backend library |
| Static media is one-size-fits-all | Individually-tailored responses |
|||

| Problem | Opportunity |
|----------|-----------|
| Generic AI has a decentralized knowledge base | Constrain bot to source information from proprietary database |
| Blogging is inefficient | Increased premium on personal outreach and the arts——face-to-face, video, audio, community service |
| Parents can't answer kids' questions | Parents (or children) can relay these to CathGPT in real-time |

This web application uses PDFs of Catholic books in the public domain. 

For the initial prototype, I have loaded the database with the *Catechism*, a condensed version of the *Summa Theologiae*, a USCCB book on the *Holy Bible*, a book called *General Catholic Devotions*, the *Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church*, and *The Imitation of Christ* by Thomas à Kempis.

---

I intend to eventually load more books with the guidance of a spiritual authority and some funds to pay for the cloud services. Currently, I am using a ChatGPT API and a key that is linked to my personal credit card.

If this website is shared and usage takes off, I will likely rack up a hefty bill. It is less than a cent per message currently, so feel free to play around with it yourself. However, please refrain from sharing indiscreetly.

---

I am currently exploring partnering with the Thomistic Institute and Dominicans on the board of Aleteia. 

I am also looking for donors to support this work. I have no programming background, so we are looking to hire a programmer. Additionally, server costs may exceed $50,000 per year. I plan to apply for 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, so donations will be tax deductible. Please make a pledge [here](https://forms.gle/94YB1BWA22nXBRdP9).

Without further ado, please play around with this and offer any thoughts. You can reach me at ammarmplumber@gmail.com or at my personal phone number +1 214-604-2136.
